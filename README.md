<h3> Title: Weather Dashboard</h3>
<h5><i>With Forecast Data</i></h5>

<h3>Description:</h3> 
    This project uses Ajax and Jquery funationality to display a wather dashboard for a user-inputed city.  The project utilizes Ajac to call data from Open Weather API (3 different calls are made when the search button is clicked).    
    JQuery functions dynamically created the elements listed below on the dashboard.  If a user wants to see a previous search, they can click on the name of the city searched in the left menu under the search bar.  When this happens, the application retrieves that city's data from local storage and displays it.  
    
    The current weather dashboard dynamically changes in the following ways:

        1) The current weather data is presented in the main container. This data is CURRENT weather: the current temperature, humdity, wind speed, and UV Index.
        2) The current UV Index is color-coded based on 3 levels of seeverity (green for ok, yellow for moderate level, and red for severe index).
        3) the current weather forecast includes a weather icon image associated with the forecast: sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.

    the 5-Day weather forecast appears below the current weather.  It changes dynamically in the following ways:

        4) A weather icon associated with the forecasted weather
        5) temperature & humidity;
        6) the date is also represented for the forecasted weather

    Finally, the left sidebar contains the search engine with a record of previous sities searched during that instance of the application.  When the user clicks on the name of a prevous search, the dashboard changes to display the data for that city.
